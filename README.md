# AI-Letter Generator
Our original goal was to extract text from an image and generate a font using that image. However, as a stepping stone, this takes a dataset of 32x32 fonts.
It actually works pretty well right now.

# To-Do
Retrain the model with possibly more epochs because the loss is currently pretty high (Loss D: 0.3675882816314697, Loss G: 3.241739273071289)

# Known Issues
Complex letters like G or Q may have issues and take a few reruns to finally get a letter that's clearly the intended letter.
