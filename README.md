## AI Letter Generator
# Project Overview
Developed in collaboration with Noah Cha, this project explores generative typography using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN). Our original goal was to extract text from images and generate custom fonts, with this project serving as a crucial stepping stone in that journey.

# Features
- Generates 32x32 pixel grayscale letters using deep learning
- Implements a Conditional GAN for precise letter generation
- Supports generation of individual letters from A-Z

# To-Do
- Retrain the model with more epochs to reduce loss
- Improve generation of complex letters like G and Q

# Known Issues
- Complex letters like G or Q may have issues and take a few reruns to finally get a letter that's clearly the intended letter.
